          My story as simple. I started making simple websites
          as a young man hoping to make a little money. Pretty quickly after starting that, I decided to
          learn HTML & CSS, wanting more control over the design of my pages. I then decided to learn Javascript/jQuery
          to make my pages more dynamic, where I immediately got hooked and got addicted to continuously progressing.
